=== Radioamator's calculator

This application contains a set of useful calculations sometimes needed in radioamator's practice. 
During development, there was a goal to create not only useful application, but deep test my library 
[[https://github.com/chav1961/purelib|Pure Library]] on it (bugs, functionality, easy-to-use 
and so on). I hope, that the first goal is not strongly damaged by second one
